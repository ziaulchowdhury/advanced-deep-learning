# Exercise - 1: Practical Tasks

## Task 2.1 Accuracies 

| Activation function | Optimizer     | Learning rate  | Epochs   | Accuracy |
|:-------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| LeakyReLU           | SGD           | 0.0001         | 3        | 41%      |
| LeakyReLU           | Adam          | 0.0001         | 3        | 51%      |
| Tanh                | SGD           | 0.0001         | 3        | 44%      |
| Tanh                | Adam          | 0.0001         | 3        | 53%      |
| ReLU                | SGD           | 0.0001         | 3        | 42%      |
| ReLU                | Adam          | 0.0001         | 3        | 51%      |

Best result (i.e. 53% accuracy) was achieved by using Adam optimizer with Tanh activation function, learning rate 0.0001 and 3 epochs.
