# Exercise - 3: Practical Tasks

### Accuracies

| Learning rate  | Epochs   | Accuracy |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| 1e-6           | 1        | 6%       |
| 1e-3           | 20       | 97%      |


With higher number of epochs (i.e. 20), accuracy of the model increased to 97%. In contrary, when the model is trained for 1 epoch only, accuracy is very low (i.e. 6%).

### PCA and T-SNE

### Overall remarks on PCA & T-SNE

It can be observed from the image of the above experiments that T-SNE can seperate the digits properly and keeps local distances in lower dimension. In contrary, digits are somehow overlapping with PCA.
